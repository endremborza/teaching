# Applied Algorithm Design for Data Processing

Borza Endre, Dorm√°n Hanga

## Goals

### Gaining a deeper understanding of data intensive algorithm design

- Identifying and tackling bottlenecks in efficiency either in implementation or algorithmic complexity
- Estimating the scalability needs of a problem and establishing intuition for picking the right tool
- Finding and implementing the appropriate search algorithms for different kinds of data

### Discovering and using new tools

- Scientific computing and data science resources within the python ecosystem, with maybe one glance towards Julia.
- Useful formats and parsing methods for tabular and unstructured data.
- Workflow automation and collaboration tools for CI/CD and 
- Visualization and dashboard composition on different scales

### Learning to work together on a data project

- Relying heavily on version control related resources
- Reflecting on the evolution of the planning stage of a project, including creating subtasks for a main task
- Getting familiar with the notion of diverging expected and actual workload for a task
- Finding the right amount of energy to put into documentation and clean code practices

### Learning to ask creative questions of the data

- Practicing freedom in feature engineering
- Dealing with open ended problems
- Incorporating domain knowledge to analysis


## Prerequisites

- Capability of solving complex problems using programming
- Comfortable competence in python, with some experience with pandas
- Introductory complexity analysis
- Basic knowledge of nested and tabular data structures
- Familiarity with git

## Methods

Participants will work in groups, and the general pattern of the course will be: one class introducing a challenge to the groups and setting a deadline, followed by one or two classes of loosely related material, with the next class the groups presenting their solutions and evaluations. This repeats for three or four challenges depending on the deadlines and progress.

## Evaluation

Evaluation will be based on performance during group challenges, one midterm test of the more theoretical material and a final group project that the participants will have to plan and implement.
